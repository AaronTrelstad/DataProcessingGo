An implementation of the Brotli compression algorithm, which is used to compress HTTP content. It has better performance than GZIP

1. LZ77: Finds repeated sequences and replaces them with a encoding
2. Huffman Coding: Statistical method that assigns shorter codes to more frequent values
3. Context Modeling: Looks at the neighboring context of data to make more informed encodings
